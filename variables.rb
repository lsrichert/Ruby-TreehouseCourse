#Valid variable names - same as method names.
#All lower case
#Numbers are legal but rarely used
#Snake case - separate words with underscores. 

#Challenge
##Assign the string "Ruby" to a variable named language. Then assign the string "awesome" to a variable named description. 
#Then make a single call to puts and pass it two arguments: the language and description variables. (Remember that if you're providing multiple arguments for a method call, you separate them with commas.)

language = 'Ruby'
description = 'awesome'
puts language, description
